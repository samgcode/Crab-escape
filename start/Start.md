You are an important member of *The Cult of The Crab*. You have shown your unwavering devotion to the *King Crab* and have risen to be a very high ranking member of the cult. You are even a *candidate* to become a member of the *Grand Clack* which is a group of the 10 highest ranking cultists, the right-claw crabs to the leader themselves. One at a time you and the other candidates go into a room to stand before the *Grand Clack* council.

\*loud clacking*

You see the previous candidate come out of the room. It's your turn next.

Upon entering the room you see that surrounding you are many crabs watching the ceremony.

\*ambient clacking*

On of the councils members speaks up
