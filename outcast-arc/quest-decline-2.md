The crowd begins to encroach further

\*clicking gets louder*

One of the council members slams their metal plated claw into the ground with a loud thud

Crabathan: ***SILENCE***!!!

\*clicking abruptly stops*

The silence hangs in the air for what feels like almost the length of an Eberly lecture

Crabthew: You **fool**. You dare throw aside everything you have done to be here today? You spit in the face of all the sacrifices that have been made to bring this society to greatness. ***GUARDS!*** Take this *creature* away.
