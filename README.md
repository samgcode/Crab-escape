# Crab escape
Crab escape is a game made for the Text Based Game Jam 2023! This game was made entirely using markdown, and hosted with github pages. This means that the entire game is made using plain text (with some minor formatting from markdown syntax), and the only interactivity available is [hyperlinks](./bozo.html). Yep, that's it. You can see all the markdown pages at the [github repo](https://github.com/samgcode/Crab-escape)
