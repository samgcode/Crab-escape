Crab escape is a point and click adventure game (also known as a "Wikipedia simulator"). All of the story is told through descriptions at the top of each page. Any action you can take will be a different color and underlined, like [this](./bozo.html).

There is also a secret ending if you find all #endings endings :0
Alright that's it, have fun!
## [Play](Start.html)
[home](./) 

## Race mode
Less of a game mechanic and more of a challenge run. Basically the goal is to get to a pre specified ending as soon as possible, starting from the home page. You can also do it while racing a friend for extra fun ^w^
